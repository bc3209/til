# Listing All Of The Database Specific Tasks

Rails ships with a bunch of tasks out of the box. To see all of those tasks, we run: `rails -T`

```bash
rails about                              # List versions of all Rails framework...
rails action_mailbox:ingress:exim        # Relay an inbound email from Exim to ...
rails action_mailbox:ingress:postfix     # Relay an inbound email from Postfix ...
rails action_mailbox:ingress:qmail       # Relay an inbound email from Qmail to...
rails action_mailbox:install             # Copy over the migration
...
```
Say you only wanted to see database specific tasks. You run the same command from above, but this time you pass in the `db` option.

`rails -T db`

```bash
rails db:create              # Creates the database from DATABASE_URL or config...
rails db:drop                # Drops the database from DATABASE_URL or config/d...
rails db:environment:set     # Set the environment value for the database
rails db:fixtures:load       # Loads fixtures into the current environment's da...
rails db:migrate             # Migrate the database (options: VERSION=x, VERBOS...
rails db:migrate:status      # Display status of migrations
...
```
