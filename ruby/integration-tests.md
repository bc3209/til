# Integration Tests

Integration tests are higher up on the food chain compared to [unit tests](unit-tests.md). We test larger chunks of code when writing integration tests. A very well known example of integration tests are the Rails's integration tests. They allow us to test an entire applications flow from start to finish. Signing up, logging in and filling out a form just to name a few. The purpose of writing integrations tests is to make sure that all of the moving parts (code, database, etc...) are all working and moving in the right direction.
