# Unit Tests

Unit tests are usually the first tests we write when testing our code. They test our code in small distinct parts. We set our foundation for how we build our other test types with unit tests. Unit tests should be focused on the smallest unit possible. A class, a method or a module. By doing this, we make both our tests and their results more accurate.
