# Which Users Are Currently Logged In?

The `who` commands gives us the username, terminal the user is logged in on, and the time that a user logged in.

`$ who:`

```bash
bennett  console  Mar 27 00:31
bennett  ttys001  Mar 30 23:50
bennett  ttys004  Mar 27 00:39
bennett  ttys005  Mar 27 00:39
bennett  ttys007  Mar 27 00:39
```
