# Show The Status Of Currently Running Processes

The `ps` command, otherwise known as the process status command, gives us
information about active processes.

Here's what I got after running the command on my machine.

```
PID  TTY        TIME    CMD
2701 ttys000    0:00.04 /Applications/iTerm.app/Contents/MacOS/iTerm2 --server /usr/bin/login -fpl bennett /Applications/iTerm.app/Contents/MacOS/iTerm2 --l
