# TIL

> Today I Learned

A fun and simple way to track small things I learn on a day to day basis. I got the inspiration from [Josh Branchaud](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til), after coming across his repo and thinking, "what a great idea," especially for someone like myself, that is fairly new to the world of web development.
