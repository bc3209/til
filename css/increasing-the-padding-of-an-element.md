# Increasing The Padding Of An Element

*Note to myself...*

Padding, margin, and border are all used to control the space that surrounds `HTML` elements. `HTML` elements are essentially little rectangles.

`padding` is used to generate space *around* the content and inside the border of an element.

The `padding` shorthand property goes clockwise: `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left`.
