# Media Queries

Media queries are rules in `css` that let you add styling only if certain conditions are met, such as a specific browser width.

```css
@media screen and (min-width: 480px) {
  body {
    background: orange;
  }
}
```
The media query above says, if the browser is 480 pixels and above, make the background orange.
